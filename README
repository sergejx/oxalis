Oxalis is web site editor. It is created for editing static web sites.


Requirements
------------

- Python 2.4
- PyGTK 2.6
- GnomePythonExtras (you need only GtkMozembed and GtkSourceView)
- [sitecopy](http://www.lyra.org/sitecopy/)
   (if you want to use uploading to server)


Installation
------------

For installing Oxalis, just run as root

    ./setup.py install

After installation you can select Oxalis in Applications -> Development menu or
run it with command

    oxalis


**Note for Fedora Core users**: If Oxalis don't run and just write error message
like this:

    ImportError: libgtkembedmoz.so: cannot open shared object file:
    No such file or directory

create file `/etc/ld.so.conf.d/mozilla.conf` and write path to Mozilla libraries
in it. For example:

    /usr/lib/mozilla-1.7.13/
    
Then run `ldconfig` as root. 

**Note for Ubuntu users**: You will need to install python-dev package, before
installing Oxalis

    apt-get install python-dev

If Oxalis crashes when you click to Preview tab, it is caused by bug #26436 [1].
To fix it replace line

	Exec=oxalis

with

	Exec=LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/firefox oxalis

in file `/usr/share/applications/oxalis.desktop`
