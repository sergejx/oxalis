Oxalis is a web site editor. It is created for editing static web sites.

Motivation and Goal
-------------------

A lot of web sites are created by single author and do not contain any dynamic
content, but still are dynamically generated by server-side scripts. The reason
for this is that content management systems (CMS) simplify creation and
management of a web site by usage of templates, simplified editing of the pages
(using lightweight languages like Markdown or using WYSIWYG editors), etc.
Tools that provide some of these services for building static web sites (like
Jekyll and nanoc) are becoming very popular.

Oxalis offers different approach to this problem â€” it integrates simple static
site generator into graphical user interface. It can be viewed as a CMS for
web sites where online editing is not required.
